    <p>Park Ji-min (Korean: 박지민; born October 13, 1995), known mononymously as Jimin, is a South Korean singer and dancer. In 2013, he made his debut as a member of the South Korean boy band BTS, under the record label Big Hit Entertainment.

Jimin has released three solo tracks under BTS' name—"Lie" in 2016, "Serendipity" in 2017, and "Filter" in 2020—all of which have charted on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart. He released his first credited solo song, the digital track "Promise", which he co-wrote, in 2018 and recorded the duet "With You" with Ha Sung-woon for the soundtrack for the TvN drama Our Blues in 2022. Jimin released his debut solo album, Face in 2023. It debuted at number one in South Korea and Japan, and number two in the United States, while its second single, "Like Crazy", debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, making him the highest-charting Korean solo artist in history on the Billboard 200 and the Hot 100 at the time, and the first to debut atop the latter.[A]</p>

    <p>"Serendipity" and "Lie" both surpassed fifty million streams on Spotify in 2018, followed shortly thereafter by the former's full length version from BTS' Love Yourself: Answer (2018) compilation album, which achieved the milestone in early 2019. Jimin became the first Korean artist to have three solo tracks accumulate over 50 million streams each, surpassing Psy, who previously crossed the 50 million streams mark twice with "Gangnam Style" (2012) and "Gentleman" (2013).[14][15] Both songs were also the only solos by a BTS member included in the Official Chart Company's (OCC) list of the top 20 most streamed BTS songs in the United Kingdom as of October 2018, ranking at number 17 and 19 respectively.[16] In April 2019, the list was expanded to reflect the top 40, and both tracks were the highest ranked solos included that year, at numbers 18 and 20 respectively.[17][18]

In May 2019, Jimin became the first BTS member to have a solo music video achieve 100 million views on YouTube when "Serendipity" surpassed the milestone.[19][20] He remained the only BTS member with multiple solo songs in the January 2020 update of the OCC's top 40 list: "Lie" and "Serendipity" were the second and third most-streamed solos, at numbers 24 and 29 respectively, with the full-length version of the latter at number 38.[21][22] The following month, Jimin earned his first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 with "Filter", which debuted at number 87 on the chart,[23] as well his first number one on the World Digital Song Sales chart. The song set the record for the biggest streaming debut among all Korean songs on Spotify, accruing over 2.2 million streams in its first 24 hours of release, and went on to become the fastest Korean solo in the platform's history to surpass 20–60 million streams.[24][25] It was also the only solo album track by BTS to receive a Song of the Year nomination at the Gaon Chart Music Awards.[26][27] In March 2021, "Filter" became the 15th BTS song to spend a full year on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart.[28][better source needed] It was the longest-charting Korean song released in 2020 on the ranking,[29] having spent 80 weeks on the chart as of the issue dated October 9, 2021.[30]

Jimin was awarded the fifth-class Hwagwan Order of Cultural Merit in 2018, alongside his bandmates, by the President of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, for their contributions to the promotion of Korean culture.[31] Three years later, Moon appointed him Special Presidential Envoy for Future Generations and Culture, alongside his bandmates, to help "lead the global agenda for future generations" and "expand South Korea's diplomatic efforts and global standing" in the international community.[32]

    <p>On December 30, 2018, Jimin released "Promise", his first credited song as a solo artist, for free on BTS' SoundCloud page.[42] It earned the biggest 24-hour debut in SoundCloud history with 8.5 million streams, surpassing previous record holder Drake's "Duppy Freestyle" which received 4.9 million streams,[43] and would go on to become the most streamed song on the platform by December 2021, with over 300 million streams.[44] Described by Billboard as a "mellow pop ballad",[45] the song was composed by Jimin and Big Hit producer Slow Rabbit, who also produced the track,[46] and features lyrics written by Jimin and bandmate RM.[45] Jimin released his second solo song "Christmas Love", about his childhood memories of the holidays, on December 24, 2020.[47] In 2022, he contributed the single "With You", a duet with Ha Sung-woon, to the soundtrack of the TvN drama Our Blues; the single was released on April 24.[48]

In January 2023, Jimin co-wrote and featured on the single "Vibe" by Taeyang.[49][50] His first official solo project since BTS announced an increased focus on individual music endeavors a year prior,[51] the single earned Jimin his debut entry on the Billboard Hot 100 as a solo artist, at number 76.[52] He was announced as a global ambassador for Dior later that month,[53] and as a brand ambassador for Tiffany & Co. in March.[54] "Promise" and "Christmas Love" were made available on streaming platforms worldwide as official singles under Jimin's name on March 6.[55] His debut solo album Face was released on March 24.[56] It set several chart and sales records, debuting at number one in South Korea and Japan,[57] and number two in the US, making Jimin the highest-charting Korean solo artist of all time on the Billboard 200.[58][59] The album's two singles, "Set Me Free Pt. 2" and "Like Crazy", released on March 17 and 24 respectively,[60][61] both entered the Hot 100: the former debuted at number 30,[62] while the latter debuted at number one, making Jimin the first South Korean solo artist in history to top the chart.[63] In May, he appeared as a featured artist, alongside Jvke and Muni Long, on the single "Angel Pt. 1" by Kodak Black and NLE Choppa, as part of the soundtrack for the film Fast X.[64]</p>

    <p>Jimin was the last Big Hit trainee to be added to the lineup that would eventually become BTS. Of the band's seven members, he spent the shortest period of time—six months—as a trainee prior to debuting.[9] On June 13, 2013, he debuted as a vocalist and dancer in BTS with the song "No More Dream" from their first single 2 Cool 4 Skool.[10] Under the band's name, he released three solo songs: "Lie", "Serendipity", and "Filter". "Lie" was released in 2016, as part of the band's second Korean studio album, Wings. It was described as stunning and dramatic, conveying dark undertones and emotions in line with the overall concept of the album.[11] In contrast, "Serendipity", from the band's Love Yourself: Her (2017) extended play (EP), was soft and sensual, expressing the joy, conviction, and curiosity of love.[12] "Filter", a track from BTS' 2020 studio album Map of the Soul: 7, had a Latin pop flair, with lyrics reflecting the different sides of Jimin that he shows to the world and those around him.[13]

"Serendipity" and "Lie" both surpassed fifty million streams on Spotify in 2018, followed shortly thereafter by the former's full length version from BTS' Love Yourself: Answer (2018) compilation album, which achieved the milestone in early 2019.
